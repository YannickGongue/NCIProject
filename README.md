# NCIProject

NCIProjects aims to develop a web portal where final year students can upload all the details of their project in a timely and straightforward manner. This project should be a helpful addition to the college staff and shorten the process of putting together the Project Showcase Booklet

Technologies
.NET MVC5: the framework for building the web portal. 
ASP.NET allows this project to be scalable and allows for separation of concerns with the Model-View-Controller.
Web Forms: another aspect of the .NET framework. Web Forms differ from MVC in that they can be standalone applications but may also be included within a MVC application. In this project, Web Forms provide the crucial functionality for producing the Showcase Booklet pdf.
C#: the programming language used to create the .NET platform. The Controllers (or logic) and Models of the application is developed using C#.
SQL Server Database: Microsoft’s Relational Database Management System. Used to hold all data relating to Students and Project Submissions.
Razor: This is syntax based on the C# language used to provide logic to Web Pages (View).
Azure: Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. The project will be deployed through the Azure service
